# LensAI
## Integrated Machine and Deep Learning for Optical Systems

Welcome to **LensAI**, a collection of studies where machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are applied to the field of optics and optical design. These studies leverage the power of AI to investigate and solve challenges in lens design, wavefront correction, ray tracing, and more, all using the open-source lens design tool [Optiland](https://github.com/HarrisonKramer/optiland) alongside standard scientific libraries.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in active development. New notebooks are added regularly.

# Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks exploring how ML and DL can be used to enhance and automate various tasks in optical engineering, including but not limited to:

- Lens Design Optimization
- Aberration Classification and Correction
- Wavefront Error Prediction and Correction
- Inverse Design of Lens Systems
- Reinforcement Learning for Optical Design
- Generative Lens Design
- Super-resolution Applications in Wavefront Detection
- Deep Learning for Optimal Tolerance Sensitivities

By integrating AI methodologies into optics, we aim to improve the efficiency and innovation in optical system design, from faster optimizations to generating new designs.
